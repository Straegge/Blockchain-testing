The Pangaea Paradigm
==============
"**Find like-minded people. Organize yourselves. Change the world.**"

*A paradigm is a cognitive framework of specific assumptions, ways of thinking and methodologies. Pangaea was the supercontinent consisting of all of Earth's landmasses. The Pangaea Paradigm aims to create a figurative supercontinent of humanity, uniting all people in the common goal of moving forward, through the application of an action-oriented mindset, rational decision-making and technology.*

So what is it?
-------------------------
The Pangaea Paradigm is a "pure altruism-based initiative" used to connect people on a global scale. Its primary mission statement is the proof-of-concept assumption that, using today's communication technology, **anything** can be achieved by a group of people working in separate locations just as well as if they worked in the same room.

The application will allow anyone to create an AcOP, an *action-oriented project*. The key points of AcOPs are their global significance and measurable positive change (i.e. the Pangaea Paradigm is not meant to be used for local work or restricted by country borders).
Anyone can see your AcOP and apply to work together with you if they possess a specific skill or the will to learn it if they don't. This open (and decentralized) process allows people who are confused about the positive action-oriented mindset to connect with you and your project members.

Once an AcOP has reached a certain amount of members, you can reshape it into a PIO, a *positive impact organization*. This will not only allow you to reach more people, it will also give you access to the creation of a project fund. A project fund will simply be an Ethereum storage address that accepts Ether as well as certain ERC-20 tokens. The fund is open to the public which ensures complete transparency. This also means that it becomes the foundation for donations towards the PIO, and due to the decentralized nature of the platform the organization will never be able to spend the project fund on anything but contributions towards its original mission.


ToDos
========

1. Connect to IPFS through Infura and add a first file. Figure out how the connection works and how to retrieve data permanently (database necessary after all?).
2. Connect Web3j to IPFS and do some tests in a live build. Try to find existing projects that have already done this.
3. Bind the HIGH PRIO use cases (creating an AcOP, creating a PIO, applying to a project/organization) to IPFS. This means figuring out a constructive, maintainable and retrievable way of storing the data.
4. Build the UI in a userfriendly and responsive way.
